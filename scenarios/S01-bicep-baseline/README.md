---

## Meet Elena Rodriguez

> **Role**: Cloud Infrastructure Engineer at Meridian Financial  
> **Experience**: 10 years VMware administration, first Azure project  
> **Today's Challenge**: Build secure network foundation for new application in 2 weeks  
> **The Twist**: Management expects Azure expertise she's still building

_"I've been managing VMware for a decade. I know networking, I know security, but Azure feels
like learning a new language. I need to understand WHY things work here, not just copy templates."_

**What Elena will discover**: How to use Copilot as a learning partner to map her VMware knowledge
to Azure concepts, building real infrastructure while gaining transferable skills.

---

## Overview

This scenario demonstrates how GitHub Copilot serves as a **learning partner** for understanding Azure
infrastructure-as-code concepts, not just generating templates. The goal is to build transferable
knowledge so you can create and maintain Bicep templates independently.

**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Target Audience**: IT Pros, Cloud Infrastructure Engineers, VMware Admins transitioning to Azure  
**Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Prerequisites**: VS Code with GitHub Copilot Chat (Azure subscription optional for deployment)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this demo, participants will understand:

1. **What Bicep is** and how it relates to ARM templates
2. **Azure resource model** (subscriptions, resource groups, regions)
3. **Virtual Network concepts** and how they map to VMware networking
4. **Network Security Groups** for microsegmentation
5. **Storage account security** best practices
6. **Private endpoints** for secure PaaS access
7. **Module organization** for team collaboration
8. **Parameter files** for multi-environment deployments

## The Challenge: Traditional IaC Learning Curve

| Problem                   | Impact                               | Business Cost           |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Steep learning curve**  | Hours researching Azure/Bicep syntax | Delayed projects        |
| **Copy-paste templates**  | No understanding, can't troubleshoot | Extended debugging      |
| **Security gaps**         | Miss best practices without guidance | Compliance failures     |
| **No knowledge transfer** | Each project starts from scratch     | Repeated effort         |
| **Team bottlenecks**      | Only one person knows the templates  | Single point of failure |

## The Solution: Conversation-Based Learning

Instead of asking Copilot to "generate a Bicep template," we use Copilot as a **teaching partner** to:

1. **Map existing knowledge** (VMware → Azure concepts)
2. **Understand WHY** before implementing HOW
3. **Learn security patterns** while building real infrastructure
4. **Build transferable skills** for future projects

## Scenario

**Architecture to Build**:

- Virtual Network with three subnets (web, app, data tiers)
- Network Security Groups for microsegmentation
- Storage Account with private endpoint
- Tags and outputs for team collaboration

**Traditional Approach**: 45-60 minutes researching + trial-and-error  
**Conversation Approach**: 30 minutes learning + building with understanding

```
I have 10 years of VMware experience and am transitioning to Azure. Can you explain
Azure networking in terms I'd understand coming from vSphere/NSX?
```

### Bicep Syntax Errors

**Symptom**: Red squiggles, deployment failures

**Solution**: Ask Copilot to explain:

```
I'm getting this error: [paste error]. Can you explain what it means and how to fix it?
```

### Security Configuration Questions

**Symptom**: Unsure if configuration is secure

**Solution**: Ask for review:

```
Is this storage account configuration secure for production? What am I missing?
```

### Module Organization Questions

**Symptom**: File structure feels messy

**Solution**: Ask about patterns:

```
How should I organize my Bicep files for a team of 5 engineers working on multiple projects?
```

### Audience Assessment

Before starting, gauge your audience:

| Question                            | If "Yes"   | Adjust Approach               |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| "Who has used ARM templates?"       | Many hands | Skip JSON vs Bicep comparison |
| "Who has VMware experience?"        | Most       | Lean into concept mapping     |
| "Who has deployed to Azure Portal?" | Everyone   | Reference Portal equivalents  |
| "Who has used IaC before?"          | Few        | Spend more time on Phase 1    |

### Common Stumbling Points

| Phase   | Issue                            | How to Help                                                  |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Phase 1 | "Why not just use the Portal?"   | Emphasize repeatability, version control, team collaboration |
| Phase 2 | Confusion about VNet vs Subnet   | Draw diagram showing VNet as "building", Subnets as "floors" |
| Phase 3 | NSG rule priority confusion      | Explain "first match wins" with real example                 |
| Phase 4 | Private endpoint complexity      | Show before/after network diagrams                           |
| Phase 5 | "Where do parameters come from?" | Show `main.bicepparam` file pattern                          |
